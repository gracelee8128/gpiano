</html><h2>diet</h2>
<p>In nutrition, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)", target="_blank" > <h>diet</h> </a>is the sum of food consumed by a person or other organism.[1]
The word diet often implies the use of specific intake of nutrition for health or weight-management reasons
 (with the two often being related). Although humans are omnivores, each culture and each person holds some food preferences
  or some food taboos. This may be due to personal tastes or ethical reasons. Individual dietary choices may be more or less
   healthy. </p>
<p>
Complete nutrition requires ingestion and absorption of vitamins, minerals, essential amino acids from protein and essential
fatty acids from fat-containing food, also food energy in the form of carbohydrate, protein, and fat. Dietary habits and
choices play a significant role in the quality of life, health and longevity.</P>

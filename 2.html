</html><h2>BTS</h2>
<p>BTS (Korean: <a href="https://ibighit.com/bts/eng/" target="-blank">
  방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan),</a>
   also known as the
Bangtan Boys, is a seven-member South Korean boy band that began
formation in 2010 and debuted in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment.<img src="2.jpg", width=45%>
 The septet—composed of RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V, and
 Jungkook—co-writes and co-produces much of their own output.
 Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to
 include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary,
  touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth, loss, the journey towards loving oneself,
  and individualism. Their work features references to literature and psychological concepts and includes an alternative
  universe storyline. The group has released several albums and performed on several world tours.

After debuting in 2013 with their single album 2 Cool 4 Skool, BTS released their first Korean-language studio album, Dark & Wild, and Japanese-language studio album, Wake Up, in 2014. The group's second Korean studio album, Wings (2016), was their first to sell one million copies in South Korea. By 2017, BTS crossed into the global music market, leading the Korean Wave into the United States and breaking numerous sales records. They became the first Korean group to receive a certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for their single "Mic Drop", as well as the first Korean act to top the US Billboard 200 chart with their studio album Love Yourself: Tear (2018). BTS also became the fastest group since The Beatles to earn four US number-one albums, doing so in less than two years. Love Yourself: Answer (2018) was the first Korean album certified platinum by the RIAA. In 2020, BTS became the first all-South Korean act to reach number one on the Billboard Global 200 and US Billboard Hot 100 with their single "Dynamite" and remix of "Savage Love (Laxed – Siren Beat)".</P>
